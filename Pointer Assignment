Q1) Write a program to find the product of two number using pointer?Ans.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int num1, num2, *ptr1, *ptr2, product=1;
    cout<<"Enter Two Numbers: ";
    cin>>num1>>num2;
    ptr1 = &num1;
    ptr2 = &num2;
    product = *ptr1 * *ptr2;
    cout<<"\nSum of Two Numbers = "<<product;
    cout<<endl;
    return 0;
}

 Q2 : int *p, q;
